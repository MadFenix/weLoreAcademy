# Use Case: Mad Fénix

Mad Fénix has implemented all weLore functions to create a narrative, gamified, and participatory experience:

* Their viewers receive Phoenix Feathers and Gold Pieces during live streams or by participating in their initiatives. 
* Actions such as watching live streams, participating in dynamics, or voting on lore decisions are rewarded. 
* They have a store, a referral system, and a digital ownership system on Hedera. 
* Events and campaigns like "The Phoenix Seal" and the "Hispanic Web3 Hunger Games" are celebrated.
