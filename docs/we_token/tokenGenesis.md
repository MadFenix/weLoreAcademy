# Token Genesis

With the token launch during the Genesis event, a total of **20 million WEL tokens** will be released, representing **20% of the total supply**. This distribution is divided into three key areas that drive the first steps of the ecosystem:

| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Community | 15,000,000 | 75% | 15% |
| Liquidity | 3,000,000 | 15% | 3% |
| Marketing | 2,000,000 | 10% | 2% |
| **Total** | **20,000,000** | **100%** | **20%** |

### üßë‚Äçü§ù‚Äçüßë Community

The largest part of the initial unlock, with **15 million tokens**, is intended to strengthen and reward the community. This allocation is divided into two blocks:

-   **Participation in the INO:**  
    **12 million tokens**, equivalent to **12% of the total supply**, will be allocated to those who participate in weLore's *Initial NFT Offering* (INO).

-   **Airdrops for NFT holders:**  
    Another **3 million tokens** (3% of the total) will be available to be claimed daily over a period of **12 months** by holders of NFTs from the **GUARDIAN DRAGONS and CHRONICLERS** collection. This airdrop will extend for 4 more years with 12 million tokens (12% of the total) distributed linearly.

### üíß Liquidity

To ensure a solid start in the markets, **3 million tokens** (**3% of the total supply**) will be allocated to the creation of **liquidity pools** and inclusion in **centralized exchanges (CEX)**.

This reserve will be available from the **Token Generation Event (TGE)** and will be administered through a **6/10** multisignature account under weLore's control.
