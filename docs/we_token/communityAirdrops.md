# Community Airdrops

**Recognition for those who have always been there**

To thank the commitment of weLore's most loyal members, an **early airdrop** program has been designed that will distribute **3,000,000 $WEL tokens** over **12 months**, through **daily claims**. This airdrop will extend for 4 more years with 12,000,000 $WEL tokens.

The distribution will begin **once the Token Generation Event (TGE)** is completed, which will mark the official start of the airdrop. From that moment, a **daily snapshot** of the content of each wallet will be taken, and users will be able to claim their tokens based on the **weLore NFTs** they have in their possession.

To do this, it will be necessary to **connect the wallet to the weLore profile and manually claim the rewards** from the platform.

### How do rewards work?

Each type of NFT is linked to a fixed amount of monthly $WEL. **The more NFTs you have, the greater your reward**, as the amounts **automatically accumulate** according to the total amount you possess at the time of each snapshot.

| NFT Type | Number of NFTs | Multiplier | $WEL tokens/month (total per group) | $WEL tokens/month per NFT |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| GUARDIAN DRAGONS and CHRONICLERS | 220 | 1× | 220,000 | 1,000 |
| GUARDIAN DRAGON KING | 3 | 10× | 30,000 | 10,000 |
| **Total** | **223** | — | **250,000** | — |

📌 **Practical example:**  
If your wallet has **2 GUARDIAN DRAGON NFTs** and **3 CHRONICLER NFTs**, you can claim **1000 x 5 = 5,000 $WEL per month**.
