### Phased Launch: Access and Availability

The distribution of weLore INO NFTs will be carried out through the **Kabila Market Launchpad**, which will be divided into **two sequential phases**:

1.  **Phase 1:** Exclusive for early weLore members who already own enabling NFTs.

2.  **Phase 2:** Final stage open to the general public, without the need for a previous NFT.


The NFTs can be purchased in **$HBAR**, with a price **indexed to the dollar**. Availability will be different in each phase:

-   In **phase 1**, each user will have a **guaranteed allocation**.

-   In the **public phase**, **availability is not guaranteed**, as it will depend on the accumulated demand in the previous stages.
