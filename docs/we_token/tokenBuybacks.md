# Token Buybacks

At weLore, we have designed a system for buying back and distributing the $WEL token that combines economic sustainability with rewards for those who actively support the ecosystem.

### üíº Buybacks with Real Revenue

-   **30% of weLore's SaaS commissions** will be allocated to buying back $WEL tokens in the secondary market.

-   This strategy directly links business growth with token demand.


### ‚ôªÔ∏è Distribution After Buyback

Once the buyback is completed, the tokens are divided as follows:

-   **30% are permanently burned** ‚Üí This reduces the circulating supply.

-   **70% are distributed via airdrop** among those who hold key roles in the ecosystem:


#### üêâ Who Receives the Airdrops?

-   **Guardian Dragons (normal):** multiplier x1

-   **Special Guardian Dragons (only 6 exist):** multiplier x10

-   **Chroniclers:** multiplier x1


This allocation will be made **monthly**, and seeks to reward those who sustain and enrich the weLore universe.

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Disclaimer

The buyback of $WEL tokens is subject to SaaS performance. Neither weLore nor any team member guarantees the future evolution of the token price or the exact frequency or amount of airdrops.  
The market value continues to be determined by supply and demand.
