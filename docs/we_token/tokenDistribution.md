### Considerations about circulating supply

It is crucial to understand that **unlocking tokens does not mean they all enter circulation instantly**. They simply become available to be used as needed.

For example, although **20 million $WEL will be released in Genesis (20%)**, **less than 15 million** will effectively be in circulation from the start. The rest will be gradually incorporated over time.
